<p id="paragraph1">The campus features well-maintained lush green lawns, musical fountains, and a small pond, creating an ideal learning environment to stimulate intellectual and personal growth.<br/><br/>Designed and built in compliance with the highest global standards, the teaching and learning infrastructure features the most advanced elements of contemporary academic tools. With over 1,20,000 square feet of air-conditioned space, uninterrupted power supply, and a well-crafted interior, the Institute offers a world-class environment for students and faculty. All the classrooms are "smart," with high-speed data networks and large projection systems for audio and video.<br/><br/>The well-designed main classroom comfortably seats in excess of 150 students. Video conferencing capabilities are built in using state-of-the-art audio-visual equipment. They include electronic smart boards, location-sensing microphones, and multiple LCD projectors, thus enabling an enriching learning experience. Meals are available at the Food Court located in a separate building (the food that our students have is the same food that is also had by faculty and staff, and offered to visitors including distinguished dignitaries, thus ensuring quality). A separate small cafeteria is available for snacks during working hours. Residential facilities are available for students in the form of separate boys' and girls' hostels, where students stay in individual rooms, have wired and wireless network connectivity for 24 hours a day, and also have access to recreational facilities. The hostel accommodates 180 male students (single occupancy with shared bath) and 80 female students (single occupancy with shared bath); in addition there is accommodation for 48 students (double occupancy with attached bath) and four fully furnished suites for short term visiting faculty. There are also a small number of suites for visitors such as guest speakers.<br/><br/>Computing Resources - The infrastructure for WISDOM UNIVERSITY's fully wired campus consists of a high-speed fiber-optic backbone connected to the internal network through a high-end gigabit Ethernet switch. Dedicated network equipment includes printers, scanners, and other equipment. Connectivity in the campus is established at two levels. First, the local intranet implements a "virtual classroom," where all the visual material, such as presentation slides used by professors in class, are made available electronically to students. All assignments and projects are announced and submitted online.<br/><br/>The intranet also enables knowledge sharing among students. At the second level, 24*7 Internet access is available throughout campus, in both wired and wireless modes. WISDOM UNIVERSITY is one of the few institutions in India to have an active wireless LAN (and was the first to have this technology). Wireless-mode access is available throughout campus using the 802.11b protocol. In addition, high-quality Ethernet ports are installed at various locations in the building, providing wired Internet access through a proxy web server. All students have a Wi-Fi enabled laptop for their exclusive use. This ensures a student to machine ratio of better than 1:1, implying complete accessibility. This in turn allows for an individual approach to learning, providing the freedom to learn at one's own pace and focus on one's chosen domain of specialization.</p>
