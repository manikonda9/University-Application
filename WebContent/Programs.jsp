            <h1>Degree Programs</h1><hr id="line1"/><hr id="line1"/><br/>
            <h3 style="color:blue">Currently the Institute offers FIVE degree programs.</h3><br/>
                               <p><p>The Institute is a graduate school, and offers no undergraduate degree programs.</p>

<p>The graduate study programs offered lead to the Integrated Master of Technology (Integrated M.Tech.), Master of Technology (M.Tech.), the Master of Science (M.S.) by Research, and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in information technology. These programs offer training that is comparable to the best anywhere, and cater to different needs.</p><br/>

<p>WU is introducing a 5 year&nbsp;<a class="pub_link" href ="#">Integrated M.Tech.</a>&nbsp;program from 2012. The Integrated M.Tech. program is a 5-year dual degree program intended for students who have completed or are completing Plus Two (or equivalent). At the end of five years of the program, successful students get B.Tech. degree &amp; M.Tech. degree in IT.</p><br/>

<p>The&nbsp;<a class="pub_link" href="#">M.Tech</a>&nbsp;(IT) degree is intended to provide education for students who wish to work in the IT industry as practitioners. It is awarded upon successful completion of a 4-semester broad-based academic program in IT, going beyond, but incorporating essential elements of, traditional computer science. Apart from imparting technical knowledge, the program teaches managerial and other cognate skills that are essential for a successful career in today&#39;s competitive IT industry. All students enrolled in the M.Tech program are residential, full-time students.</p><br/>

<p><a class="pub_link" href="#">M.Tech. in Electronic Systems Design (ESD)</a>&nbsp;is a new programme launched by WU in 2014. It is awarded upon successful completion of a 4-semester broad-based academic programme, with specialization either in System-on-Chip (SoC) or Embedded Systems. With the onset of a new wave of revolution being unleashed by the Internet of Things (IoT) due to the availability of extremely low cost and low power hardware platforms in the form of SoCs and Embedded System boards, we are seeing the emergence of a new convergence between hardware and software. It&#39;s potential is limited only by human imagination and it&#39;s impact is being seen in the&nbsp;rapid evolution it is fostering in different domains, such as, &nbsp;automation, e-health, mobile communication, smart home, automotive sector, consumer electronics, pervasive computing, computer architecture, &nbsp;etc. The new M. Tech. (ESD) program is being launched to meet the above vision and objectives.</p><br/>

<p><a href="#">Master of Science (Digital Society):</a>&nbsp;The programme is designed to create a group of professionals who will:&nbsp;Contribute to the design, development and deployment of digital technologies for diverse social groups,Provide and manage solutions that address persistent developmental challenges in domains such as education, governance, and health;&nbsp;Engage in policy making and in advocacy for deploying digital technologies&nbsp;and &nbsp;enrich interdisciplinary research on the digital society.&nbsp;This is an interdisciplinary Master&rsquo;s program intended for graduates from any background who are interested in designing, developing, deploying and managing large ICT solutions for an inclusive and sustainable digital society. The batch size for academic year 2015-16 will be approximately 30.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a class="pub_link" href="#">M.S. by Research</a>&nbsp;degree is intended for mature students who wish to learn and perform research in a supportive academic environment. It is awarded upon successful completion of a graduate-level research program, usually lasting four semesters. Beyond the satisfaction of a relatively small number of coursework requirements, the major focus of the program is on developing research skills, leading to the completion of a Master&#39;s thesis describing significant original results. Most M.S. by Research students are working professionals (some already working as research scientists in reputed organizations or government bodies), who are sponsored by their employers</p><br/>

<p>The&nbsp;<a class="pub_link" href="#">Ph.D.</a>&nbsp;is the terminal, research-oriented degree in the subject, intended to prepare students for research, teaching, and scholarly careers in academic settings or research laboratories. It connotes a superior comprehension of the field and a high aptitude for research, and is awarded upon completion of a program that takes from 3 to 5 years (there are no hard limits). Beyond the satisfaction of a relatively small number of coursework requirements, the major focus is on carrying out a significant body of original research, the writing and the defense of a doctoral dissertation describing this work.<br />
